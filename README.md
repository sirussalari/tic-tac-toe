# tic-tac-toe

This project is an assignment part of the Odin Project curriculum.

This is a simple program written in Ruby that runs completely in the terminal.

The program consists of two different classes. The first class is for the board, and the second class is for the players.

Once you run the program in terminal, you are prompted to enter your name and your opponent's name, and there are now instances of both players created.

After the players have been created, then the board is created, and the first player is prompted to choose which row they would like to place a piece. If the user enters any number besides 1, 2, or 3, then the program prompts the user to enter a number again. After this, the player is then prompted to type which column they would like to place a piece. Similar to the row, the program only allows users to enter 1, 2, or 3.

After the player has entered their row and column respectively, the board is displayed in the terminal with the player's piece added to the board. After this move, the program then checks to see if the game is over either by a player winning or from a tie. If the game is not over, then the program prompts the other player to then choose which row and column they would like to place their piece.

Once the game is over, the program will print out to the terminal who the winner is, or if it was a tie.
